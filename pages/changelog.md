#### 2. Added `page` query.
For example: (page "Page Alias"):
{{query (page "Page Alias")}}
#### [main.js](/assets/pages_changelog_1611805815460_0.js)

`Notice`: It could be slow with page that has many blocks.
There's a bug with block timestamps enabled, so we disabled it temporally.

#### 3. Add `git-auto-push` to settings page, you can disable the auto push and type `Ctrl+s` to push yourself :)
